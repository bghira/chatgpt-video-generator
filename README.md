# ChatGPT-4 Video Generator 🤖🎞️

Welcome to the *ChatGPT-4 Video Generator*, a project that aims to showcase
the power of ChatGPT-4 by generating simple video files using the AI model.
The project structure is designed to be flexible, modular, and whimsical,
sprinkled with a dash of absurdity to make your coding journey a delightful
experience. 🎉

## Project Structure 🏗️

- `classes/`: Contains our AI-powered classes, such as `MeltProject` and
  `OpenAI`, which are the building blocks of our video generation process.
- `scripts/`: A collection of automation scripts that help maintain and extend
  the project. From minifying classes to generating class summaries, these
  scripts will empower you with magical AI abilities. 🧙
- `minified/`: A home for the minified versions of our classes.
- `LICENSE`: The Silly Use License (SUL-1.0), because why not have some fun
  while coding? 😜

## Extending the Project 🚀

To further develop this project and add new features, simply follow these
steps:

1. Run the `class_summary_generator.php` script to generate a summary of
   existing classes and their method signatures for ChatGPT-4.
2. Use the summary as a reference when conversing with ChatGPT-4 to provide
   contextual information.
3. Watch as ChatGPT-4 helps you craft new code using the existing classes and
   project structure.
4. Run the `minify_classes.php` script to minify your classes in a way that
   they can be provided to ChatGPT for modification without using too many
   tokens. These classes end up in the `minified` directory.

So, what are you waiting for? Unleash the power of ChatGPT-4 and create some
incredible video files today! 🚀🌟
